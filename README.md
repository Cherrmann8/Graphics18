Museum Plan
We've chosen the theme of BEARS for our museum.
The current plan for the layout of the museum is 3 rooms connected in the center, with an entryway that could potentially be a giftshop or something of that nature. The bear statue we have planned will go in the center of the center room, and the pictures we choose will hang in the other three rooms. 10 of the walls and the floor and ceiling are all made up of identical objects that build the shape of the building and the four triangular shapes on top are also identical to each other.
We have not found textures for our floors and walls yet. We're firsting going to find our art and then we will choose the best textures to compliment them.

We will have a model of a bear that Molly will create, if she has time, or otherwise obtain if she does not hae enough time or skill to build one herself.
We have not found the pictures for our museum yet, but for the time being our plan is to photoshop bears into famous paintings.
